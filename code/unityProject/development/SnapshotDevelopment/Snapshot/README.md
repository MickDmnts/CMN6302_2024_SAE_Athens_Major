## Introduction

This is the main git repository for my major project in Games Programming-BSc (HONS) for SAE Athens.
The Major Project is based on the following [Major Project Proposal](https://github.com/MichaelEvangelosD/cm6302_majorSAE/blob/master/docs/CMN6100.S3_MichailEvangelosDiamantis_1313246.pdf) which was submitted and got highly-graded in February the 25th of 2024.

## Folder Definitions

- **Code Samples:** Here the raw source files of various code samples I'm providing in the project paper can be found.
- **Docs:** The source .docx and .pdf files of the development of the paper can be found here.
- **Imgs:** Every image, screenshot and self-made diagram can be found here.
- **Refs:** Almost every external paper, article, book, journal etc that will be cited in the paper can be found here.
  - Since, many sources are gathered through [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/search/) around 90% of the cited work is not visible in the **Refs** folder
